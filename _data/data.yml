        I work in an Agile Team for Research & Development of new products.
        My role is to help the clients of my company to automate their business processes.
        The Product Owner (PO) in my team appends new user stories every two weeks in a backlog.
        I am also adding user stories when needed by our consultants and UX experts.
        I handle legacy code (25yo) as much as I build software using new technologies.
        My work can be divided in three main epics currently:
          - Bundle websites for sales admin to manage their business documents
          - Make existing and new mail printing factories work around the world
          - Ensure AI-based solutions are incrementally learning from the client documents

        As we provide a paying software, I am very careful about client data. Esker and I make sure the ISO27001 is respected.
